1) updating falsepositiverate

Whenever totalVCs or falsePositiveRate in config.json is updated,
run BloomFilterConfigurationGenerators() function from main to get 'numberOfIndexesPerEntry' value for Bloom Filter.

Then, update
NUMBER_OF_INDEXES_PER_ENTRY_IN_BLOOMFILTER constant in techniques/bloomFilter.go
numberOfHashFunctions constant in deployments/contracts/revocationservice.sol
numberOfHashFunctions constant in /contracts/revocationservice.sol

Then follow the instructions in contracts/instructions.txt to get updated contract bindings

Compile and deploy contract. check instructions deployments/instructions.txt

Then update the contract address in config.json. The contract is returned by truffle migrate command.



2) running new experiments

deploy contract : check instructions deployments/instructions.txt
Then update the contract address in config.json. The contract is returned by truffle migrate command.



3) starting ganache blockchain cli

ssh â€“i revocation_service ubuntu@158.39.48.29

ganache-cli -h 158.39.48.29 -l 80000000 --account="0x1c804da8039c8ce928391bc45dad7405615d42e2672fa9fc282cccce246c251a,100000000000000000000000"

Note: upgrade ganache from v6 to v7. otherwise, it would give op code error.
